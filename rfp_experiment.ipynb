What from this experience do you think will be relevant and of benefit for Uber - (max. 300 words)\\n\\nAs an organization, Media.Monks has developed a key focus on the tech sector, with a majority of our revenue across all practices coming from leading, global technology companies. This experience allows us to bring a unique point of view to Uber's business from a series key vantage points:\\\\n\\\\nFirst, as an Agency, Media.Monks partners with a broad swath of technology clients, spanning multiple technology subverticals (payments, b2b + consumer commerce, and entertainment and cryptocurrency, to name a few). That breadth of experience arms us with a deeper understanding not only of industry-specific media strategies, but also of the agility required to execute at the pace that the sector requires. Within the delivery space, our content practice has produced best-in-class experiences and content to drive greater adoption and usage of delivery apps. On the back end, our analytics practice has helped implement and leverage leading analytics technologies to distill key learnings and optimize media campaigns across digital channels.\\\\n\\\\nSecond, as technologists, we develop leading, first-to-market technologies that create efficiencies not just for ourselves, but our advertiser clients, as well. For example, our Inflection Engine is a proprietary tool that uniquely captures signals - both macro and behavioral, that anticipate changes in consumer sentiment and analyze competitive behavior to inform and influence media strategies. We understand from our own experience the lifecycle of tech development, the things that go into creating market-leading technologies, and the intrinsic value that they offer to the market.\\\\n\\\\nThese experiences have informed not just how we engage with clients, but in how we build best in class technologies to drive results. We recognize the need to move at the speed of Uber - that is, to move and adapt at the pace of change, and bring technologies that will help accelerate decisions and drive performance for Uber. \\\\n\\\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease mention your 3 key clients relevant to Uber (not necessarily tech ride share or delivery)\\nPlease feel free to explain why you think they are relevant to Uber\\nPayPal\\\\nShopify\\\\nNetflix\\n\\n\\n\\nConflict Management\\nPlease provide a summary of how you approach conflict and confidentiality management within your agency group specifically if working with a key competitor (max 300 words):\", metadata={'source': './rfi_cleaned.csv'}), Document(page_content='Yes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is assumed that your agency will allow Uber direct access to any trading platform to access pricing and that agency supports all processes to transfer data from platforms.

Briefly describe your supplier diversity efforts to increase opportunities for certified diverse-owned companies to do business with your firm and how you will promote first party relationships with certified diverse suppliers including media owners with Uber.\\\\nPlease provide examples.\"Yes. In 2022, we launched the first phase of our Supplier Diversity Program. The program is baked into a larger ESG assessment for our vendors. In this first phase, led by our procurement team,  a select group of vendors (based on the level of criticality of the partnership) receive a questionnaire to uncover any diversity business certifications, DE&I policies and programs, to assess leadership team diversity, and to measure activity that supports environmental sustainability. In our next phase, we intend to expand our Supplier Diversity program to work with other parts of our organization that are in charge of securing vendors (e.g. production teams, office teams, etc.). We\\'ll provide updates as this program evolves/progresses.\\\\n', metadata={'source': './rfi_cleaned.csv'}), Document(page_content=\"Conflict Management\\nPlease provide a summary of how you approach conflict and confidentiality management within your agency group specifically if working with a key competitor (max 300 words):\\n\\nMedia.Monks’s approach to team separation, physical security, data security, and organizational structure delivers best in class client confidentiality, while still tapping into our global network of capabilities.  Our unitary structure ensures confidence in your confidentiality and security. Our processes and protocols can be thought of across a series of key categories:\\\\n\\\\nOnboarding: Beyond any specific contracts the company or individual team members might have signed with the client, each employee has signed a confidentiality agreement when hired covering their responsibilities regarding maintaining client confidentiality and security. New team members receive an overview of our client confidentiality practices and any specific measures for a particular client team. Likewise, when offboarding a team member, they are reminded of our best practices and their responsibilities.\\\\n\\\\nSoftware Security: We are implementing a process to assess every new application or SaaS from a security and privacy perspective to ensure it accomplishes the requirements defined. Some aspects analyzed are security by design, access control security configuration, data encryption in storage and transit, data handling, and more.\\\\n\\\\nIt is our policy to install off-the-shelf software packages according to the specifications of the supplier and avoid further modifications. The use of pirated software is strictly forbidden.\\\\n\\\\nA client first approach to office space: Secure space for meetings and client conversations is provided that ensures that team members have access to areas that are soundproof and offer the ability to restrict visual access to the space. Employees are required to erase information on whiteboards at the end of each meeting, and whiteboards are cleared by staff twice a day as an additional measure.\\\\n\\\\nInfosec: We’ve adopted an ISO 27001 Information Security Management System for protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. We are committed to improving our ISMS on a constant basis.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith reference to Uber's competitors listed in the Competitor List (tab D) please confirm whether any of these companies are existing clients for agencies in your network.\\nPlease also flag in case you believe any other companies in your portfolio could identify as competitor\\nBoth Doordash and Instacard are currently on our client roster, however, our relationship with each company focuses solely on our content and creative capabilities, and not within media or data.\\\\n\\\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUber Requirements\\nShould you be the winning agency we would seek a contractual arrangement at parent / holding company level. Please confirm your:\\nContracting entity:\\nWe are able to offer S4Capital or MediaMonks Inc as the contracting entity.
